# metrics_bubble_react

This React project was created as an interview coding challenge. 

## Requirements

This project is to code a small "metrics" component that we can reuse across different views. This widget displays a weight and a label.

The widget is comprised of the following pieces:
- Label, STRING (ex: "Upper Body" or "Core")
- Weight, INTEGER (between 0 and 350)
- Unit (always "lbs")
- Background circle with graph

Regarding fonts, the label font is Helventica. The weight and unit fonts are League Gothic.

When delivering this widget, please build a screen that demonstrates its use. This screen should also include a form that allows the user to modify the Label and the Weight to see the widget update as changes are made to the form.
